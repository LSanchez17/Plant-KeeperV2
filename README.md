# Plant-KeeperV2
This contains the front end for the new version of Plant Keeper

## Why a separation?
Easier to maintain, and update.  Previous iteration used Jinja templating with inheritance and blocks.  While it works, with the new version and features that need to be implemented, modularity and functionality are more important.  React is a good choice, and provides a separation of concerns, as the previous version was intertwined in terms of front end and back end.
